# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
During this assignment we we're challenged with gathering data from buses in Boston. Once we acquired the coordination information we then chose one bus to add to a map via our access token on MapBox. Once we wrote the code we were able to track the movements of the bus throughout the city of Boston.
